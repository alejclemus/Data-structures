    "- It is extremely simple.\n",
    "- It executes quickly on resource-limited processors.\n",
    "- There is no simple class of inputs for which collisions (identical outputs) are especially likely.\n",
    "- Given a small, privileged set of inputs (e.g., reserved words for a compiler), the permutation table can be adjusted so that those inputs yield distinct hash values, producing what is called a perfect hash function.\n",
    "- Two input strings differing by exactly one character never collide.It is extremely simple.\n",
